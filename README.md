# Workshop Outline Builder

This simple HTML/JavaScript application helps plan multi-day training workshops.  Modules such as lessons or activities can be dragged from the list on the left onto a time grid representing the schedule for each day.  Each module has a duration and may be color coded.

## Features
- Generate a grid for 1â€“10 days with custom start and end times.
- Drag modules onto the grid to schedule them.
- Move scheduled modules to a new time or back to the module list by dragging.
- Create custom modules with a specific duration and title.
- Module groups (SA, PA, etc.) allow filtering of the module list.

## Usage
Open `BlockOutlines.html` in a modern browser and click **Generate Grid** to create the schedule layout.  Drag items from the module list into the grid.  Grab any cell of a scheduled module to move it elsewhere or drag it back to the list to unschedule.
